## Project Overview

This project involved modernizing critical conveyor control systems at a Tier 1 mining operation in the Pilbara region. The existing relay-based control system was reaching end-of-life, causing frequent unplanned shutdowns and impacting production targets.

The upgrade delivered a modern PLC-based control system with integrated SCADA, predictive maintenance capabilities, and remote monitoring for the mining company's Perth-based Remote Operations Center (ROC).

### The Challenge: Aging Infrastructure in 24/7 Operations

**Operational Constraints:**
- 24/7 production environment with minimal shutdown windows
- Critical path infrastructure - conveyor failure stops entire production line
- Harsh Pilbara environment (heat, dust, vibration)
- Aging relay-based control with no diagnostics
- No remote visibility for ROC operations team

**Business Pain Points:**
- Unplanned downtime averaging 12+ hours per month
- Production losses of $200K+ per outage
- Reactive maintenance only (no predictive capability)
- No trend data for optimization
- Safety concerns with aging equipment

**Technical Challenges:**
- Hot-cutover required (minimize production loss)
- Integration with existing VFD drives and motor control
- SCADA integration for Perth ROC monitoring
- Condition monitoring implementation
- Compliance with mining safety standards (AS 4024)

### Solution Architecture

**Control System Modernization**

Replaced relay-based control with Schneider Modicon PLC platform:
- **Primary PLC**: Schneider M580 for main conveyor control logic
- **Safety PLC**: Separate safety-rated controller for emergency stops and interlocks
- **Distributed I/O**: Remote I/O racks along 2km conveyor run
- **Networking**: Redundant Ethernet/IP backbone with Modbus TCP for legacy devices

**SCADA Integration**

Wonderware System Platform for operations visibility:
- Real-time conveyor status and diagnostics
- Alarm management with escalation to ROC
- Trend analysis for predictive maintenance
- Production metrics and KPIs
- Remote control capability from Perth ROC

**Predictive Maintenance**

Implemented condition monitoring for:
- **Vibration monitoring**: Early bearing failure detection
- **Motor current analysis**: Detect mechanical overload or blockages
- **Temperature monitoring**: Bearing and motor temperature trending
- **Belt alignment**: Laser alignment sensors
- **Run-time tracking**: Maintenance scheduling automation

from scipy import signal

def analyze_vibration(vibration_data, sampling_rate=10000):
    """
    Analyze vibration data for bearing fault frequencies.
    Returns alert level: 0=Good, 1=Warning, 2=Critical
    """
    # FFT analysis
    frequencies, power_spectrum = signal.periodogram(
        vibration_data,
        fs=sampling_rate
    )

    # Bearing fault frequencies (example for SKF 6308 bearing @ 1500 RPM)
    bpfo = 96.9  # Ball Pass Frequency Outer race (Hz)
    bpfi = 128.1 # Ball Pass Frequency Inner race (Hz)
    bsf = 49.8   # Ball Spin Frequency (Hz)
    ftf = 10.1   # Fundamental Train Frequency (Hz)

    # Check for elevated energy at fault frequencies
    fault_frequencies = [bpfo, bpfi, bsf, ftf]
    alert_level = 0

    for fault_freq in fault_frequencies:
        # Find power at fault frequency (±5% tolerance)
        freq_range = (fault_freq * 0.95, fault_freq * 1.05)
        mask = (frequencies >= freq_range[0]) & (frequencies <= freq_range[1])
        fault_power = np.max(power_spectrum[mask])

        # Thresholds determined from baseline
        if fault_power > CRITICAL_THRESHOLD:
            alert_level = 2  # Critical - schedule immediate maintenance
            break
        elif fault_power > WARNING_THRESHOLD:
            alert_level = max(alert_level, 1)  # Warning - monitor closely

    return alert_level
```
