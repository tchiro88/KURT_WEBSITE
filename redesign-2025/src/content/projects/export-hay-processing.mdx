## Project Overview

This flagship project involved complete automation of an export hay processing facility, representing one of the largest agricultural automation projects in Western Australia. The scope included control system design, PLC programming, SCADA development, hydraulic power management, and safety system implementation.

### The Challenge

The client required a modern, safe, and efficient processing facility capable of handling high-volume export hay production. Key challenges included:

- **Legacy Integration**: Interfacing new Rockwell systems with existing hydraulic control infrastructure
- **Safety Compliance**: Meeting SIL 2 safety requirements for material handling and press operations
- **Process Optimization**: Maximizing throughput while maintaining quality standards
- **Stakeholder Management**: Coordinating between agricultural operations team, contractors, and equipment vendors

### Solution Architecture

**Control System Design**
- Rockwell ControlLogix PLC platform as the central control system
- PlantPAX SCADA for operator interface and process monitoring
- Distributed I/O architecture using Ethernet/IP network
- Redundant safety PLCs for critical safety functions

**Process Control**
- Hydraulic press control with pressure profiling
- Material conveying and sorting automation
- Environmental monitoring and control
- Quality inspection integration

**Safety Systems**
- SIL 2-rated safety interlock system
- Emergency stop network across facility
- Light curtains and safety area scanners
- Lockout/tagout (LOTO) integration

### Technical Implementation

The project leveraged my deep experience with Rockwell automation platforms:

```structured-text
// Example: Hydraulic Press Control Logic
// Simplified structured text for press cycle management

IF PressStartConditions AND SafetyPermissive THEN
    CASE PressState OF
        IDLE:
            IF StartButton AND MaterialPresent THEN
                PressState := POSITION;
                PositionTarget := CompactPosition;
            END_IF;

        POSITION:
            HydraulicValve := LOWER;
            IF PositionReached(PositionTarget) THEN
                PressState := COMPRESS;
                PressureTimer(PT := CompressDuration);
            END_IF;

        COMPRESS:
            PressureControl(SP := TargetPressure);
            IF PressureTimer.DN THEN
                PressState := RELEASE;
            END_IF;

        RELEASE:
            HydraulicValve := RAISE;
            IF TopPositionReached THEN
                PressState := IDLE;
                CycleComplete := TRUE;
            END_IF;
    END_CASE;
END_IF;
```

## Why This Matters for Perth Mining Automation

While this project was agricultural, the technical challenges and solutions are directly transferable to mining automation:

- **Hydraulic control systems** → Mining mobile equipment, conveyors
- **Material handling automation** → Ore processing, conveying systems
- **SCADA integration** → ROC (Remote Operations Center) displays
- **Safety system design** → Mining safety compliance (AS 4024)
- **Large-scale project management** → Mining capital projects

The skills, methodologies, and Rockwell platform expertise demonstrated here are in high demand across Perth mining automation roles, particularly for Pre-Sales Solution Architects and Technical Sales Engineers who need to bridge technical depth with customer-facing communication.
